Read 444885047 BAM records:
  kept 27901324 primary alignments (6.3%), of which 0 reverse reads
  skipped 42274987 primary alignments with insufficient mapping qualities (9.6%)
  skipped 12895694 excessively soft-clipped primary alignments (2.9%)
  skipped 358244075 unmapped reads (81.2%)
  skipped some suboptimal (secondary/supplementary) alignment records

  Per-sample stats (details in 'gstacks.log.distribs'):
    read 10346163.9 records/sample (2672243-25964260)
    kept 3.1%-9.5% of these

Built 38339 loci comprising 27901324 forward reads and 0 matching paired-end reads; mean insert length was 0.0 (sd: nan).

Genotyped 38339 loci:
  effective per-sample coverage: mean=61.4x, stdev=37.1x, min=16.6x, max=186.0x
  mean number of sites per locus: 138.8
  a consistent phasing was found for 32122 of out 45661 (70.3%) diploid loci needing phasing
